BASIC GAME IDEA
Click button to sell a cookie for $1
For $10, you may click a button purchase "sell two cookies at a time"
For $100, you may click a button purchase "sell 100 cookies at a time
etc.

MORE COMPLEX
You are a baker. You must bake items and sell items

Two buttons:  Bake (manufacturing cost=$1) and Sell (sales price=$2)
Improvements to baked goods:
    start with cookie (cost=$1, price=$2)
    improve to bread (cost=$2, price=$4)
    improve to cupcakes (cost=$2, price=$5)
    improve to cake (cost=$5, price=$10)
    improve to strudel (cost=$3, price=$12)
    etc.
Improvements to baking:
    start with counter (bake one item at a time)
    improve to mixer (bake 5 items at a time)
    improve to kitchen (bake 50 items at a time)
    improve to industrial kitchen (bake 250 items at a time)
    etc
Improvements to selling:
    start with stand (sell one item at a time)
    improve to farmer's market (sell 10 items at a time)
    improve to food truck (sell 100 items at a time)
    improve to storefront (sell 500 items at a time)
    improve to franchise (sell 2000 items at a time)
Automation
    hire employee (bake operation once / minute )
    hire distributor (sell operation once / minute)
    etc !!!


You will need cookies (the browser kind) for this lab (to handle Oauth). The only information that should be stored in the cookie is the user id and/or login state
Your code must implement sound logic. If you need to bake before you sell, you should not be able to sell unbaked items.
Your code must handle error conditions. Validate input, check for empty data, etc. Your server should not restart because the user inputted data in a way you were unequipped to handle.
Improvements could be made based upon a one time cost, running cost, number of sales, etc. Be creative!!!
