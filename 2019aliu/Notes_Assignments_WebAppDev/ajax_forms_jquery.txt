AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript And XML: get "infinite information" (get stuff from server)

different from handlebars
    handlebars: start on server, magic on server, finish on client
    AJAX: start on client, magic on server, finish on client

analogy: kitchen (handlebars) vs waiter (AJAX)

submit: loads entire page again (don't want to reload page for a very similar thing)

jQuery makes AJAX so much easier
