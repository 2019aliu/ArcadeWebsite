# ArcadeWebsite
The first website I've ever made, built with vanilla HTML + CSS + JS. It features a few games, including minesweeper with the map of the US, Tetris, and cookie clicker!

I made this while in Web Applications Development class. Shout out to my instructor, Paul Kosek (check out his [github](https://www.github.com/pckosek))!
